Initial states:

x1 = [1.0, 1.3]
x2 = [1.0, 1.3]
x3 = [1.0, 1.3]
x4 = [1.0, 1.3]

t = 20 steps

1) controller double pendulum less robust:
 - control step = 0.05
 - Property:
     - Each of the states should be in [âˆ’1.0, 1.7]

2) controller double pendulum more robust
 - control step = 0.02
 - Property:
     - Each of the states should be in [-0.5, 1.5]
