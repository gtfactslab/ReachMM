The set of initial states considered is as follows:
h(0)∈[−133,−129], h0_dot(0)∈{−19.5,−22.5,−25.5,−28.5}, τ(0) = 25 and adv(0) = COC

Run for K = {1,...,10} steps.

Safety property:  |Vertical separation| > 100 ft at all times.

NN normalization:
    scale_mean = [0.0,0.0,20.0,-0.432599379632]; % Means    
    scale_range =[16000.0,5000.0,40.0,3.102300001]; % Ranges
    Unn = Unn - scale_mean;
    Unn = Unn/scale_range;
    where Unn is the input to the neural networks
